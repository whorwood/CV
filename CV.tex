\cvsect{Profile}

\begin{minipage}[t]{1\textwidth} % 40% of the page width for the introduction text
	\vspace{-\baselineskip} % Required for vertically aligning minipages
Currently a final-year undergraduate at Birmingham City University studying BSc Sound Engineering \& Production with a keen interest in electronics, looking to start a career in the Audio Electronics industry. I used the opportunity of placement year to develop my skills both academically and socially within a workplace environment. This involved working with cutting edge digital mixing consoles. 
\newline
\newline
Working with precision is one of my key assets, developed through experience in the live sound sector in which small mistakes can be detrimental to the customers experience of a show. I have been interested in audio since secondary school where I organised and promoted live music events.
\newline
\newline
I have a scientific mindset which I was able to develop as part of my degree course specifically in electronics and software development modules. This extends beyond the classroom into personal projects such as designing and building a MIDI based foot pedal based on an Arduino architecture.
\newline
\newline
Communication is essential when working in any size team. I have been able to use this skill both with the public in customer service positions and in a professional manner through freelance visual and audio work.
\newline
\newline
I am a creative individual who enjoys playing guitar and piano, both writing music and performing in a folk/rock band. I also enjoy working on my own projects such as deploying a Raspberry Pi web server used to host my sound engineering blog.
